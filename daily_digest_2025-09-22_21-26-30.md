### [More Britons view AI as economic risk than opportunity, Tony Blair thinktank finds](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/22/more-britons-view-ai-as-economic-risk-than-opportunity-tony-blair-thinktank-finds)  
*Grounded✅ • risk=well-sourced*
- A survey by Tony Blair's thinktank found that 38% of Britons view AI as an economic risk, while only 20% see it as an opportunity.  
- The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) warns that public skepticism could hinder the UK’s goal of becoming an AI superpower, emphasizing the need for government efforts to build trust in the technology.  
- TBI forecasts that AI could displace between 1 million and 3 million private sector jobs in the UK, although new roles may emerge as a result.  
- The poll indicates a significant divide in perception between AI users and non-users, with over half of non-users viewing AI as a risk compared to only a quarter of regular users.  
- TBI recommends five strategies to enhance public trust in AI, including increasing public use, highlighting beneficial applications, and responsible regulation. [Cautious]

### [British AI startup beats humans in international forecasting competition](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/20/british-ai-startup-beats-humans-in-international-forecasting-competition)  
*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=low-evidence*
- A British AI startup, ManticAI, co-founded by a former Google DeepMind researcher, ranked eighth in the Metaculus Cup, an international forecasting competition.  
- The competition involved predicting the likelihood of 60 events, with AI outperforming many human forecasters, though still lagging behind the best human predictors.  
- ManticAI's system utilizes various machine-learning models to tackle forecasting problems, demonstrating a potential antidote to groupthink by producing original predictions.  
- Experts believe AI could match or surpass human forecasters by 2029, but currently, human forecasters still outperform AI in complex predictions.  
- The consensus among forecasters is that the best approach combines human intuition with AI capabilities for optimal forecasting results. [Cautious]

*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=balanced*
- UK ministers signed a multibillion-pound tech deal with US companies, which includes the construction of energy-intensive datacentres, amid rising demand driven by generative AI.  
- Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang advised UK officials to consider gas as part of their energy strategy, conflicting with the government's goal to reduce gas dependency for a net-zero transition.  
- Concerns have been raised about the environmental and societal impacts of rapid AI adoption, with experts calling for a more deliberate approach to its development.  
- The International Energy Agency projects that electricity consumption by datacentres will more than double by 2030, raising questions about the UK's ability to meet competing energy demands.  
- Research indicates that the increasing use of AI technologies may have negative social implications, including potential cognitive skill erosion in students and mental health risks linked to chatbots. [Cautious]

### [[D] Is it reasonable that reviewers aren’t required to read the appendix?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nnhkz8/d_is_it_reasonable_that_reviewers_arent_required/)  
*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=low-evidence*
- Recent conference author guidelines state that reviewers are not required to read the appendix of submissions.
- This policy allows reviewers to potentially overlook important material that addresses their concerns, as noted by an author who experienced a low score due to a reviewer not consulting the appendix.
- The author raised this issue with the area chair (AC), but the AC indicated that reviewing the appendix was not mandatory and could not be used to amend the review.
- The author seeks opinions on whether this guideline is reasonable, its impact on author behavior, and its necessity given reviewer workload.
