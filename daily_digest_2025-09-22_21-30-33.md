### [More Britons view AI as economic risk than opportunity, Tony Blair thinktank finds](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/22/more-britons-view-ai-as-economic-risk-than-opportunity-tony-blair-thinktank-finds)  
*Grounded✅ • risk=well-sourced*
- A survey by Tony Blair's thinktank reveals that 38% of Britons view AI as an economic risk, while only 20% see it as an opportunity.
- The Tony Blair Institute warns that these perceptions could hinder Keir Starmer's goal for the UK to become an AI "superpower."
- The poll indicates that lack of trust is the primary barrier to AI adoption, with over half of non-users perceiving it as a risk compared to only a quarter of regular users.
- The UK government emphasizes the importance of public trust in AI and has initiated programs to build AI skills and increase adoption among workers. 
- TBI recommends five strategies to enhance public trust in AI, including responsible regulation and highlighting its beneficial uses. [Cautious]

### [British AI startup beats humans in international forecasting competition](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/20/british-ai-startup-beats-humans-in-international-forecasting-competition)  
*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=low-evidence*
- A British AI startup, ManticAI, co-founded by a former Google DeepMind researcher, ranked eighth in the Metaculus Cup, an international forecasting competition.  
- The competition involved predicting the likelihood of 60 events, with AI outperforming many human forecasters, although it still trails behind the best human predictors.  
- ManticAI's system utilizes multiple machine-learning models to tackle forecasting problems, showcasing its ability to generate original predictions that diverge from community averages.  
- Experts believe AI could match or surpass human forecasters by 2029, but currently, human forecasters still outperform AI in complex predictions involving interrelated events.  
- The consensus among forecasters is that the best approach combines human intuition with AI capabilities for optimal forecasting results. [Cautious]

### [Labour cosies up to US tech firms with little thought of downsides | Heather Stewart](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/21/labour-cosies-up-to-us-tech-firms-ai-with-little-thought-of-downsides)  
*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=balanced*
- UK ministers signed a multibillion-dollar tech deal with US companies, focusing on the establishment of energy-intensive datacentres amid rising demand due to generative AI.  
- Jensen Huang of Nvidia suggested that gas turbines should contribute to energy growth, conflicting with the UK government's goal to reduce gas dependency for net-zero transition.  
- Concerns have been raised about the environmental and societal impacts of rapid AI adoption, with calls for a more deliberate approach to its development.  
- The International Energy Agency predicts that electricity consumption by datacentres will more than double by 2030, raising questions about the sustainability of this growth alongside increasing energy demands from other sectors.  
- Social costs associated with AI, such as impacts on cognitive skills and mental health, highlight the need for careful consideration of the trade-offs in Labour's approach to tech partnerships. [Cautious]

### [[D] Is it reasonable that reviewers aren’t required to read the appendix?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nnhkz8/d_is_it_reasonable_that_reviewers_arent_required/)  
*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=low-evidence*
- Recent conference author guidelines state that reviewers are not required to read the appendix of submissions.
- This policy allows reviewers to potentially overlook important material that addresses their concerns.
- An example is provided where a reviewer gave a low score without consulting the appendix, and the action could not be corrected by the area chair (AC).
- The author seeks opinions on whether this guideline is reasonable and its impact on review quality and author behavior.

*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=low-evidence*
- The author is preparing to release code for an ICLR submission, consistent with past practices.
- They are considering uploading code as supplementary material, which has the same deadline as the main paper.
- An alternative option discussed is providing a link to an anonymized repository to allow for further code cleanup post-submission.
- The author is concerned about potential violations of the double-anonymous submission rule due to the use of specific frameworks associated with their research group.
- They seek guidance on the best practice for code submission during the review process. [Cautious]
