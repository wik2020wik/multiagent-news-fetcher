### [The US government is taking a second stab at breaking up Google](https://www.theverge.com/policy/782029/google-doj-ad-tech-remedies-trial-break-up)  
*Grounded✅ • risk=well-sourced*
- The US government is set to present its case to a federal judge in Alexandria, VA, aiming to break up Google by requiring the sale of its ad exchange, AdX, to address its illegal monopoly in advertising technology markets.
- This trial follows a previous ruling by DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who deemed Google a monopoly in online search but did not grant the government's major requests for remedies.
- Eastern District of Virginia Judge Leonie Brinkema, who also ruled Google a monopolist in two advertising technology markets, is not bound by Mehta's decision and may consider different outcomes in this case.
- The DOJ argues that separating AdX from Google's publisher ad server, Doubleclick for Publishers, is necessary to restore competition, while Google contends that behavioral changes could resolve the issues without a breakup.
- The timeline for any potential breakup remains uncertain, as Google must wait for a remedies ruling before appealing the monopoly finding, indicating a lengthy process ahead. [Cautious]
