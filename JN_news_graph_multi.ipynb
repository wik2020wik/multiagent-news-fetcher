       "   'text': \"Responsibility & Safety\\nStrengthening our Frontier Safety Framework\\nWe’re expanding our risk domains and refining our risk assessment process.\\nAI breakthroughs are transforming our everyday lives, from advancing mathematics, biology and astronomy to realizing the potential of personalized education. As we build increasingly powerful AI models, we’re committed to responsibly developing our technologies and taking an evidence-based approach to staying ahead of emerging risks.\\nToday, we’re publishing the third iteration of our Frontier Safety Framework (FSF) — our most comprehensive approach yet to identifying and mitigating severe risks from advanced AI models.\\nThis update builds upon our ongoing collaborations with experts across industry, academia and government. We’ve also incorporated lessons learned from implementing previous versions and evolving best practices in frontier AI safety.\\nKey updates to the Framework\\nAddressing the risks of harmful manipulation\\nWith this update, we’re introducing a Critical Capability Level (CCL)* focused on harmful manipulation — specifically, AI models with powerful manipulative capabilities that could be misused to systematically and substantially change beliefs and behaviors in identified high stakes contexts over the course of interactions with the model, reasonably resulting in additional expected harm at severe scale.\\nThis addition builds on and operationalizes research we’ve done to identify and evaluate mechanisms that drive manipulation from generative AI. Going forward, we'll continue to invest in this domain to better understand and measure the risks associated with harmful manipulation.\\nAdapting our approach to misalignment risks\\nWe’ve also expanded our Framework to address potential future scenarios where misaligned AI models might interfere with operators’ ability to direct, modify or shut down their operations.\\nWhile our previous version of the Framework included an exploratory approach centered on instrumental reasoning CCLs (i.e., warning levels specific to when an AI model starts to think deceptively), with this update we now provide further protocols for our machine learning research and development CCLs focused on models that could accelerate AI research and development to potentially destabilizing levels.\\nIn addition to the misuse risks arising from these capabilities, there are also misalignment risks stemming from a model’s potential for undirected action at these capability levels, and the likely integration of such models into AI development and deployment processes.\\nTo address risks posed by CCLs, we conduct safety case reviews prior to external launches when relevant CCLs are reached. This involves performing detailed analyses demonstrating how risks have been reduced to manageable levels. For advanced machine learning research and development CCLs, large-scale internal deployments can also pose risk, so we are now expanding this approach to include such deployments.\\nSharpening our risk assessment process\\nOur Framework is designed to address risks in proportion to their severity. We’ve sharpened our CCL definitions specifically to identify the critical threats that warrant the most rigorous governance and mitigation strategies. We continue to apply safety and security mitigations before specific CCL thresholds are reached and as part of our standard model development approach.\\nLastly, in this update, we go into more detail about our risk assessment process. Building on our core early-warning evaluations, we describe how we conduct holistic assessments that include systematic risk identification, comprehensive analyses of model capabilities and explicit determinations of risk acceptability.\\nAdvancing our commitment to frontier safety\\nThis latest update to our Frontier Safety Framework represents our continued commitment to taking a scientific and evidence-based approach to tracking and staying ahead of AI risks as capabilities advance toward AGI. By expanding our risk domains and strengthening our risk assessment processes, we aim to ensure that transformative AI benefits humanity, while minimizing potential harms.\\nOur Framework will continue evolving based on new research, stakeholder input and lessons from implementation. We remain committed to working collaboratively across industry, academia and government.\\nThe path to beneficial AGI requires not just technical breakthroughs, but also robust frameworks to mitigate risks along the way. We hope that our updated Frontier Safety Framework contributes meaningfully to this collective effort.\\nFootnotes\\n*We built our Framework around capability thresholds called Critical Capability Levels (CCLs). These are capability levels at which, absent mitigation measures, frontier AI models or systems may pose heightened risk of severe harm.\",\n",

       "   'text': \"Science\\nDiscovering new solutions to century-old problems in fluid dynamics\\nOur new method could help mathematicians leverage AI techniques to tackle long-standing challenges in mathematics, physics and engineering.\\nFor centuries, mathematicians have developed complex equations to describe the fundamental physics involved in fluid dynamics. These laws govern everything from the swirling vortex of a hurricane to airflow lifting an airplane’s wing.\\nExperts can carefully craft scenarios that make theory go against practice, leading to situations which could never physically happen. These situations, such as when quantities like velocity or pressure become infinite, are called ‘singularities’ or ‘blow ups’. They help mathematicians identify fundamental limitations in the equations of fluid dynamics, and help improve our understanding of how the physical world functions.\\nIn a new paper, we introduce an entirely new family of mathematical blow ups to some of the most complex equations that describe fluid motion. We’re publishing this work in collaboration with mathematicians and geophysicists from institutions including Brown University, New York University and Stanford University\\nOur approach presents a new way to leverage AI techniques to tackle longstanding challenges in mathematics, physics and engineering that demand unprecedented accuracy and interpretability.\\nThe importance of unstable singularities\\nStability is a crucial aspect of singularity formation. A singularity is considered stable if it is robust to small changes. Conversely, an unstable singularity requires extremely precise conditions.\\nIt’s expected that unstable singularities play a major role in foundational questions in fluid dynamics because mathematicians believe no stable singularities exist for the complex boundary-free 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Finding any singularity in the Navier-Stokes equations is one of the six famous Millennium Prize Problems that are still unsolved.\\nWith our novel AI methods, we presented the first systematic discovery of new families of unstable singularities across three different fluid equations. We also observed a pattern emerging as the solutions become increasingly unstable. The number characterizing the speed of the blow up, lambda (λ), can be plotted against the order of instability, which is the number of unique ways the solution can deviate from the blow up. The pattern was visible in two of the equations studied, the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and Boussinesq equations. This suggests the existence of more unstable solutions, whose hypothesized lambda values lie along the same line.\\nWe discovered these singularities by incorporating machine learning techniques such as second order optimizers for training neural networks. These methods allowed us to refine our accuracy to an unprecedented level. For reference, our largest errors addressed are equivalent to predicting the diameter of the Earth to within a few centimeters.\\nHere we show an example of the vorticity (Ω) field found for one of the equations studied. This is a measure of how much the fluid is spinning at each point.\\nWe also show a one-dimensional slice through the same field along an axis for all of the instabilities we discovered, showing the evolution of increasingly unstable singularities.\\nNovel method navigates a vast landscape of singularities\\nOur approach is based on the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional neural networks that learn from vast datasets, we trained our models to match equations which model the laws of physics. The network's output is constantly checked against what the physical equations expect, and it learns by minimizing its ‘residual’, the amount by which its solution fails to satisfy the equations.\\nOur use of PINNs goes beyond their typical role as general-purpose tools used for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). By embedding mathematical insights directly into the training, we were able to capture elusive solutions — such as unstable singularities — that have long-challenged conventional methods.\\nAt the same time, we developed a high-precision framework that pushes PINNs to near-machine precision, enabling the level of accuracy required for rigorous computer-assisted proofs.\\nA new era of computer-assisted mathematics\\nThis breakthrough represents a new way of doing mathematical research, combining deep mathematical insights with cutting-edge AI. We’re excited for this work to help usher in a new era where long-standing challenges are tackled with AI and computer-assisted proofs.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was a joint effort by: Yongji Wang, Mehdi Bennani, James Martens, Sébastien Racanière, Sam Blackwell, Alex Matthews, Stanislav Nikolov, Gonzalo Cao-Labora, Daniel S.

From the 139 competing teams, only the top four teams won gold medals.\\nGemini solved 10 of 12 problems, achieving gold-medal level\\nAn advanced version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think competed live in a remote online environment following ICPC rules, under the guidance of the competition organizers. It started 10 minutes after the human contestants and correctly solved 10 out of 12 problems, achieving gold-medal level performance under the same five-hour time constraint. See our solutions here.\\nGemini solved eight problems within just 45 minutes and two more problems within three hours, using a wide variety of advanced data structures and algorithms to generate its solutions. By solving 10 problems in a combined total time of 677 minutes, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think would be ranked in 2nd place overall, if compared with the university teams in the competition.\\nDr. Bill Poucher, ICPC Global Executive Director, stated: “The ICPC has always been about setting the highest standards in problem solving. Gemini successfully joining this arena, and achieving gold-level results, marks a key moment in defining the AI tools and academic standards needed for the next generation. Congratulations to Google DeepMind; this work will help us fuel a digital renaissance for the benefit of all.”\\nGemini solved a problem no university team solved\\nIn an unprecedented moment, our model successfully and efficiently solved Problem C within the first half hour — which no university teams in the contest solved.\\nProblem C required finding a solution for distributing liquid through a network of interconnected ducts to a set of reservoirs, with the goal of finding a configuration of these ducts that fills all the reservoirs as quickly as possible. There are an infinite number of possible configurations, as each duct may be open, closed or even partially open, making it very difficult to search for the optimal configuration.\\nGemini found an effective solution with a clever insight: it first assumed each reservoir has a \"priority value\" representing how much each reservoir should be favored compared to the others. When given a set of priority values, the best configuration of the ducts can be found using a dynamic programming algorithm. Gemini discovered that by applying the minimax theorem, the original problem can be approached by finding the priority values that make the resulting flow most constrained. Leveraging the relationship between priority values and optimal flows, Gemini used nested ternary searches to quickly find optimal priority values in the bowl-like convex solution space, and solved Problem C.\\nGemini’s performance brings together a series of advances\\nOur milestone performance brings together a series of advances across pretraining, post-training, novel reinforcement learning techniques, multi-step reasoning and parallel thinking. These innovations helped Gemini explore different ways of solving complex problems, verifying solutions and continuously iterating before responding.\\nFor example, during the course of reinforcement learning, we trained Gemini to reason and generate code for some of the most difficult problems coders have faced, to learn from feedback on results and evolve its approaches. To tackle a problem, multiple Gemini agents each propose their own solutions, use terminals to execute code and tests, and then iterate the solutions based on all attempts.\\nOur internal studies show that a similar version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think can also achieve gold-medal level performance in the 2023 and 2024 ICPC World Finals, performing as well as the world\\'s top 20 competitive coders.\\nExploring Gemini\\'s potential as a collaborator\\nAchieving gold-medal level at the ICPC has immediate, practical consequences for software development and shows that AI can act as a true problem-solving partner for programmers. If the best AI and human solutions in the competition were combined, all 12 problems would have been solved completely and correctly. This shows the potential for AI to provide unique, novel contributions that complement the skills and knowledge of human experts.\\nBeyond math and coding, our achievement demonstrates a powerful new capability in abstract reasoning. The skills needed for the ICPC — understanding a complex problem, devising a multi-step logical plan and implementing it flawlessly — are the same skills needed in many scientific and engineering fields, such as designing new drugs or microchips. It shows that AI is moving from just processing information to actually helping solve some of the world\\'s most difficult reasoning problems in ways that could benefit humanity.\\nGemini users with Google AI Ultra subscriptions can already use a lightweight version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think in the Gemini app. And in the near future, much smarter AI coding assistants could help developers tackle increasingly complex engineering challenges. From logistics and debugging to scientific research, solutions to some of the hardest, most unsolvable problems may soon be within reach by using AI as a collaborative tool.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) for their support.\\nThis project was a large-scale collaboration, and its success is due to the combined efforts of many individuals and teams.

       "   'text': 'Science\\nUsing AI to perceive the universe in greater depth\\nOur novel Deep Loop Shaping method improves control of gravitational wave observatories, helping astronomers better understand the dynamics and formation of the universe.\\nTo help astronomers study the universe’s most powerful processes, our teams have been using AI to stabilize one of the most sensitive observation instruments ever built.\\nIn a paper published today in Science, we introduce Deep Loop Shaping, a novel AI method that will unlock next-generation gravitational-wave science. Deep Loop Shaping reduces noise and improves control in an observatory’s feedback system, helping stabilize components used for measuring gravitational waves — the tiny ripples in the fabric of space and time.\\nThese waves are generated by events like neutron star collisions and black hole mergers. Our method will help astronomers gather data critical to understanding the dynamics and formation of the universe, and better test fundamental theories of physics and cosmology.\\nWe developed Deep Loop Shaping in collaboration with LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) operated by Caltech, and GSSI (Gran Sasso Science Institute), and proved our method at the observatory in Livingston, Louisiana.\\nLIGO measures the properties and origins of gravitational waves with incredible accuracy. But the slightest vibration can disrupt its measurements, even from waves crashing 100 miles away on the Gulf coast. To function, LIGO relies on thousands of control systems keeping every part in near-perfect alignment, and adapts to environmental disturbances with continuous feedback.\\nDeep Loop Shaping reduces the noise level in the most unstable and difficult feedback loop at LIGO by 30 to 100 times, improving the stability of its highly-sensitive interferometer mirrors. Applying our method to all of LIGO’s mirror control loops could help astronomers detect and gather data about hundreds of more events per year, in far greater detail.\\nIn the future, Deep Loop Shaping could also be applied to many other engineering problems involving vibration suppression, noise cancellation and highly dynamic or unstable systems important in aerospace, robotics, and structural engineering.\\nMeasuring across the universe\\nLIGO uses the interference of laser light to measure the properties of gravitational waves. By studying these properties, scientists can figure out what caused them and where they came from. The observatory’s lasers reflect off mirrors positioned 4 kilometers apart, housed in the world’s largest vacuum chambers.\\nSince first detecting gravitational waves produced by a pair of colliding black holes, in 2015, verifying the predictions of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, LIGO’s measurements have deeply changed our understanding of the universe.\\nWith this observatory, astronomers have detected hundreds of black hole and neutron star collisions, proven the existence of binary black hole systems, seen new black holes formed in neutron star collisions, studied the creation of heavy elements like gold and more.\\nAstronomers already know a lot about the largest and smallest black holes, but we only have limited data on intermediate-mass black holes — considered the “missing link” to understanding galaxy evolution.\\nUntil now, LIGO has only been capable of observing very few of these systems. To help astronomers capture more detail and data of this phenomena, we worked to improve the most difficult part of the control system and expand how far away we can see these events.\\nReducing noise and stabilizing the system\\nAs gravitational waves pass through LIGO’s two 4 kilometer arms, they warp the space between them, changing the distance between the mirrors at either end. These tiny differences in length are measured using light interference to an accuracy of 10^-19 meters, which is 1/10’000 the size of a proton. With measurements this small, LIGO’s detector mirrors must be kept extremely still, isolated from environmental disturbance.\\nThis requires one system for passive mechanical isolation and another control system for actively suppressing vibrations. Too little control causes the mirrors to swing, making it impossible to measure anything. But too much control actually amplifies vibrations in the system, instead of suppressing them, drowning out the signal in certain frequency ranges.\\nThese vibrations, known as “control noise”, are a critical blocker to improving LIGO’s ability to peer into the universe. Our team designed Deep Loop Shaping to move beyond traditional methods, such as the linear control design methods currently in operation, to remove the controller as a meaningful cause of noise.\\nA more effective control system\\nDeep Loop Shaping leverages a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards and surpasses state-of-the-art feedback control performance.\\nIn a simulated LIGO environment, we trained a controller that tries to avoid amplifying noise in the observation band used for measuring gravitational waves — the band where we need the mirror to be still to see events like black hole mergers of up to a few hundred solar masses.\\nThrough repeated interaction, guided by frequency domain rewards, the controller learns to suppress the control noise in the observation band. In other words, our controllers learn to stabilize the mirrors without adding harmful control noise, bringing noise levels down by a factor of ten or more, below the amount of vibrations caused by quantum fluctuations in the radiation pressure of light reflecting off the mirrors.\\nStrong performance across simulation and hardware\\nWe tested our controllers on the real LIGO system in Livingston, Louisiana, USA — finding that they worked as well on hardware as in simulation.\\nOur results show that Deep Loop Shaping controls noise up to 30-100 times better than existing controllers, and it eliminated the most unstable and difficult feedback loop as a meaningful source of noise on LIGO for the first time.\\nIn repeated experiments, we confirmed that our controller keeps the observatory’s system stable over prolonged periods.\\nBetter understanding the nature of the universe\\nDeep Loop Shaping pushes the boundaries of what’s currently possible in astrophysics by solving a critical blocker to studying gravitational waves.\\nApplying Deep Loop Shaping to LIGO’s entire mirror control system has the potential to eliminate noise from the control system itself, paving the way for expanding its cosmological reach.\\nBeyond significantly improving how existing gravitational wave observatories measure further and dimmer sources, we expect our work to influence the design of future observatories, both on Earth and in space — and ultimately help connect missing links throughout the universe for the first time.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis research was done by Jonas Buchli, Brendan Tracey, Tomislav Andric, Christopher Wipf, Yu Him Justin Chiu, Matthias Lochbrunner, Craig Donner, Rana X Adhikari, Jan Harms, Iain Barr, Roland Hafner, Andrea Huber, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Charlie Beattie, Joseph Betzwieser, Serkan Cabi, Jonas Degrave, Yuzhu Dong, Leslie Fritz, Anchal Gupta, Oliver Groth, Sandy Huang, Tamara Norman, Hannah Openshaw, Jameson Rollins, Greg Thornton, George van den Driessche, Markus Wulfmeier, Pushmeet Kohli, Martin Riedmiller and is a collaboration of LIGO, Caltech, GSSI and GDM.\\nWe’d like to thank the fantastic LIGO instrument team for their tireless work on keeping the observatories up and running and supporting our experiments.',\n",
