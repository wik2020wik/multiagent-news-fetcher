### [More Britons view AI as economic risk than opportunity, Tony Blair thinktank finds](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/22/more-britons-view-ai-as-economic-risk-than-opportunity-tony-blair-thinktank-finds)  
*Grounded✅ • risk=well-sourced*
- A survey by Tony Blair's thinktank found that 38% of Britons view AI as an economic risk, while only 20% see it as an opportunity.
- The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) warns that these perceptions could hinder Keir Starmer's goal for the UK to become an AI superpower.
- TBI's director emphasized the need for the UK to build public trust in AI to lead in technology adoption, as it cannot compete with the US and China in AI development.
- The poll revealed that over half of those who have not used AI perceive it as a risk, compared to only a quarter of regular AI users.
- TBI made five recommendations to enhance public trust in AI, including increasing public use, highlighting beneficial applications, and responsible regulation. [Cautious]

### [British AI startup beats humans in international forecasting competition](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/20/british-ai-startup-beats-humans-in-international-forecasting-competition)  
*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=balanced*
- A British AI startup, ManticAI, co-founded by a former Google DeepMind researcher, ranked eighth in the Metaculus Cup, an international forecasting competition.  
- The competition involved predicting the likelihood of 60 events, with AI outperforming many human forecasters, although it still trails the best human predictors.  
- ManticAI's system utilizes various machine-learning models to tackle forecasting problems, demonstrating a unique approach that allows for original predictions, potentially countering groupthink among human forecasters.  
- Experts believe AI could match or surpass human forecasters by 2029, but currently, human forecasters still outperform AI in complex predictions involving interrelated events.  
- The consensus among forecasters is that the best results may come from a collaboration between human intuition and AI capabilities. [Cautious]

*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=low-evidence*
- UK ministers signed a multibillion-dollar tech deal with US companies, focusing on the establishment of energy-intensive datacentres to support the growth of generative AI.  
- Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, suggested that the UK should increase gas usage to support new industries, conflicting with the government's goal to reduce gas dependency for net zero.  
- Concerns have been raised about the environmental and societal impacts of the rapid growth of generative AI, with calls for a more deliberate approach to its development.  
- The International Energy Agency predicts that electricity consumption by datacentres will more than double by 2030, raising questions about the sustainability of this growth amid increasing energy demands.  
- The UK faces challenges reconciling the energy needs of datacentres with other demands, such as the transition to electric vehicles and the shift from gas boilers to heat pumps. [Cautious]

*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=low-evidence*
- The author is seeking guidance on creating black-and-white images of satellite photos of rivers from skeleton images.
- They have a dataset consisting of pairs of satellite river photos and skeleton segmentations.
- The goal is to train a generator for converting skeleton images into satellite images, potentially using an additional conditioning variable.
- The author notes that most existing literature on this topic is over six years old and is looking for recent methods or papers for reference. [Neutral]

### [[P] Tracking generation provenance in multi-model workflows](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nn5wex/p_tracking_generation_provenance_in_multimodel/)  
*Needs-check⚠️ • risk=balanced*
- The article discusses challenges in tracking generation provenance in production RAG systems, particularly when documents are created through multiple model iterations.
- The proposed approach involves storing prompt embeddings, tracking model/version fingerprints, maintaining conversation context graphs, and enabling temporal queries.
- It was found that documents generated through multiple models exhibit different semantic patterns compared to those produced by a single model, highlighting the importance of the prompt chain.
- Currently, 103 documents are being tracked, each with up to 9 versions, allowing for queries based on content and prompt similarity.
- The implementation, which uses a standard RAG pipeline, incurs a 15% storage overhead but improves query precision by 40%. [Bullish]
